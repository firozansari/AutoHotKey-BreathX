# AutoHotKey-BreathX

Breathing exercises are techniques that focus on controlling and regulating your breath. People have been doing these things for centuries in different cultures, and they have numerous benefits for physical and mental well-being. BreathX is a very basic AutHotKey script that helps you to control and regulate your breath.

Usage is self-explanatory. Run the script; the tool will run at the bottom-right corner of the screen. 

You can control the duration of inhale, hold, and exhale using the following variables (values are in milliseconds) in the script.

```ahk
; Breathing Configs (in Millisecond)
inhaleDuration := 4000
pauseAfterInhale := 7000
exhaleDuration := 8000
pauseAfterExhale := 100
```

Following are some popular breathing techniques:
### 2:1 Breathing
- 4.0s Inhale 
- 8.0s Exhale 

### 4-7-8 Breathing
- 4.0s Inhale 
- 7.0s Pause

- 0.0s Pause 

### Box Breathing
